## Understanding

Speed is added or subtracted on a selected axies when buttons are pressed.

Things I see:

set speeds and sizes

size of the screen

where the score location is placed

player controls

## Planning required changes

Change the players speed to a higher number

Change the backdrop color to red

Change the player starting position
    -create/change static contexpr

When player hits start the game should restart
    -add with in the while true loop

Make it when the player loop around the screen it
    -when the playr is in a certain y or x position telerport it to the same position but +/-

Make a speed boost
    -change the speed for 3 seconds then change it back

## Brainstorming game ideas

- If the player touches the border the game restarts

- Add sound effect when scoring a point

- Enemy slowly follows the player, if player touches it, the game ends

- Game starts paused and pauses when player dies


## Plan for implementing game

 - Making it where it hits the border you lose the game
    - Restart the game once you hit the border (MIN/MAX X/Y values)

- Enemy Slowly Folowing you around
    - Enemy is helf the speed, if you hit the enemy you lose
    - algorithm for the enemy
        - get the players x and y
        - add 1 in the direction of the player on borth x and you

- Sound plays for each action and key press (besides dpad)

- Pauses the game with an if statement to keep movement speed locked to 0
